# Welcome to the exercise-configure-dependabot exercise!

This exercise checks FILL THIS IN. It is automatically graded via a workflow once you have completed the instructions.

## About this exercise

A grading script exists under `.github/workflows/grading.yml`. You do not need to use this workflow for any purpose and **altering its contents will affect the repository's ability to assess your exercise and give feedback.**

<details><summary>:information_source: About the use of GitHub Actions in this exercise</summary>
 
> This exercise utilizes [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), which is free for public repositories and self-hosted runners, but may incur charges on private repositories. See [About billing for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) to learn more. The use of GitHub Actions also means that it may take the grading workflow a few seconds and sometimes minutes to run.

<!-- OPTIONAL, only required for exercises that use PATs
<details><summary>:closed_lock_with_key: About the use of secrets and access tokens in this exercise.</summary>

> This exercise asks you to create a personal access token (PAT). This step is a prerequisite of the exercise, and you should already be comfortable with PATs on GitHub before proceeding. The PAT is encrypted and used only by a local action that does not leave your repository. GitHub has safeguards in place if the PAT is exposed by mistake, but you should know that if someone gains access to your PAT, they would have the same access you've given the token. To be safe, we recommend setting an expiration for the token. If you'd like to learn more about how your PAT is used, check the action's documentation in [`.github/actions/`](.github/actions/), [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token), and [Available scopes](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes).

<details><summary> ðŸ‘¥ About the use of organizations in this exercise</summary>

> This exercise needs to be completed in an organization. We recommend you [create a new organization](https://github.com/account/organizations/new?coupon=&plan=team_free) for free. If you choose to use an existing organization, note that this exercise will ask you to adjust settings in the organization that may have unintended effects on existing repositories or organization members.
